         <h1 id="mvf1">MVF1 - Registration and Profile Editing</h1>


         <h4 id="mvf1Description">Description</h4>
         <p>Registration will consist of fetching basic information such as name, address, and contact details. Also,
            information about the car will be collected. The main feature of the profile page will consist of allowing
            the user to see statistical information such as the time, usage and money spent throughout various car
            parks. Details include an hour by hour breakdown of cost, which may could also include each individual car
            if there are multiple cars on file with a particular profile.</p>

         <br>

         <h4 id="mvf1LucidTextualInformation">Lucid Textual Explanation</h4>
         <p>
         <ul>
            <li>The first screen presented to the user will be a log in/register page, as you need an account and need
               to provide information in order to use the application. If choosing to log in, users will simply tap the
               log in button and enter their login details (e.g, username and password) where as if they choose to 'sign
               up,' they will be greeted with a different screen of text boxes and dropdown menus in order to fill out
               their personal information and account settings.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Once their account is created, they will have a basic menu with the option to either 'View Profile,'
               'Book Parking,' 'Contact Us,' 'Manage Payment' and 'Log Out.' Each of these will take the user to a
               different page, self explanatory by their name. </li>
               <br>
            <li>Viewing their profile, the user may choose to put a picture in and have it displayed as their icon. The
               profile will show the users most recent booking, their monthly booking data and their registered
               vehicles. They may choose to register another vehicle to the account if they want, with no limit to how
               many they may choose to have.
            </li>
         </ul>
         </p>

         <br>

         <h4 id="mvf1UserStories">User Stories</h4>
         <p style="font-style: italic;">"As a time-compromised user, I want registration and sign up to be quick and
            easy, with minimum interaction needed to sign up"</p>
         <p>Individuals who are time compromised will require the registration to be quick and effortless. The
            application registration process shouldn't take too long, and the user shouldn't be required to enter main
            fields of data just to get to the booking page. This means that only important information regarding the
            user's contact details and payment details are required to be asked and collected. The details collected
            from the user should be limited to name, address, contact and payment details. Unlike other registration
            processes, Quick Park application should avoid trying to have email confirmation and making the user wait
            longer to be able login and use the application. The user should be easily and quickly prompted to answer
            the initial set up details and have access to the application. Given that the Quick Park application is used
            to make parking convenient for users, the registration process should also reflect that so that users can
            download and secure the parking effortlessly. </p>

         <br>

         <p style="font-style: italic;">"As a new-tech user, I want the login to be automatic when the app loads"</p>
         <p>The Quick Park application should be easily manageable by those who are not competent in using technology.
            The application should be able to guide the user to step by step go through the registration and profile,
            quick bookings, live tracking, payment and contact/feedback. The user should be prompted to complete one
            step and move on to the next one without being overwhelmed by multiple features and sections, where they
            aren't able to satisfactorily navigate through the application. This allows the user to connect better with
            the application and the easier the user finds the application the more likely they are going to use it to
            make quick parking bookings. Getting user satisfaction levels high is very important and can drive the
            demand for 'Quick Park' application growth through word of mouth and pure convenience. </p>

         <br>

         <p style="font-style: italic;">"As a novice driver, I want the app to be easily accessible"</p>
         <p>Novice drivers would like to have a reassurance app such as Quick Park to be able to rely on in terms of
            finding quick parking effortlessly. It is vital to ensure that these individuals are not turned off by
            asking too much information especially using jargons that they might not be familiar with being a new
            driver. Understanding the type of user and making the registration and profile process very simple and
            effortless is vital. The application should be able to be accessed quickly and remotely, therefore
            functionalities should be catering for this need. The user should be able to use a mobile or a computer and
            still be able to access the same information anytime anywhere. Having an application like Quick Park can
            increase new drivers' confidence and also help their driving experience. </p>

         <h4 id="mvf1ValidationCriteria">Validation Criteria</h4>
         <p>There are several validation types that can be used to check data and information that is being entered by a
            user.</p>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Format check: </b>
               this is used to check if data is in the correct format. In relation to the registration page, this can
               be used when entering a date of birth, email address, phone number or home address, as these are
               examples of data fields that need to be entered in a specific format. The date could also be validated
               by utilising a date picker on the device.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Existence check: </b>this is used to check if data has been entered at all. In relation to the
               registration page, all fields such as name, email, etc will need to be validated as having something
               entered in the field.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Lookup table: </b>this is used to check for acceptable values in a table. In relation to the
               registration page, when a user enters an address, it needs to be cross checked using an external database
               such as google maps, in order to confirm that that the address exists. Additionally, when a user is
               adding a vehicle to their account, they need to enter make and model, and this can be checked through an
               external vehicle database, such as using the license plate through a VicRoads registration check to get
               the vehicle details.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Length check: </b>this is used to check if data is of a particular length. In relation to the
               registration page, a password length should be made clear to the user, and this length should be checked
               upon registration.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Type check: </b>this is used to check the data type of the information entered. In relation to the
               registration page, a type check can be performed on a phone number (numbers only).</li>
            <br>
         </ul>
         <p>We also need to determine a list of acceptance criteria to help us set a user's expectation for our
            application. This can be done by generating possible scenarios that a user may experience and outline the
            expectations of that scenario. We can generate this using the Given/When/Then template. </p>
         <ul>
            <p><b>Scenario: </b>User creates an account and logs in</p>
            <p>"Given I'm in a role of a new user</p>
            <p>When I open the register page</p>
            <br>
            <p>Then the system shows me the personal details form containing "First Name", "Last Name", "Phone Number",
               "Home Address" and "Email Address" which are required fields </p>
            <p>When I fill in the "First Name" field with my first name </p>
            <p>And I fill in the "Last Name" field with my last name </p>
            <p>And I fill in the "Phone Number" field with a valid phone number </p>
            <p>And I fill in the "Home Address" field with a valid address </p>
            <p>And I fill in the "Email Address" field with a valid email address </p>
            <p>And I click the "Continue" button </p>
            <br>
            <p>Then the system shows me the vehicle details form containing "Vehicle Make", "Vehicle Model", "License
               Plate" and "Account Password" which are required fields </p>
            <p>When I fill in the "Vehicle Make" field with a valid vehicle make </p>
            <p>And I fill in the "Vehicle Model" field with a valid vehicle model</p>
            <p>And I fill in the "License Plate" field with my license plate number</p>
            <p>And I fill in the "Account Password" field with a suitable password </p>
            <p>And I click the "Finish Signup" button </p>
            <br>
            <p>Then the system shows me the login form containing "Phone Number", "Password" and "I agree to the terms and conditions" which are required fields </p>
            <p>When I fill in the "Phone Number" field with my phone number I used to register </p>
            <p>And I fill in the "Password" field with my password I used to register </p>
            <p>And I check the "I agree to the terms and conditions" checkbox </p>

            <br>
            <p>Then the system shows me my account dashboard where I can access all features that the app provides" </p>
