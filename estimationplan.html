         <b> MVF1: Registration and Profile Editing : 15 hours </b>
         <ul>
            <li> 2 hours: learning </li>
            <li> 2 hours: research </li>
            <li> 3 hours: design </li>
            <li> 6 hours: coding </li>
            <li> 2 hours: testing </li>
         </ul>

         <p> Registration and Profile editing will be the first feature that user encounters. Extensive research should
            be conducted by browsing through other applications and taking inspiration from their registration
            processes, which can account for the 2 hours of research and learning. Design is important for any section
            of an application, especially if this page will determine whether the user ends up registering an account
            and use the application, 3 hours of design should be adequate for this. Extensive knowledge of both local
            and cloud data storage will be required for this, so 6 hours of coding should be the bare minimum in
            ensuring that this feature runs as intended, ranging from validation and storage of user account
            information. This feature is perhaps the most important one to be working properly, so it should be
            extensively tested for every possible user scenario to ensure that a user won't experience any issues, 2
            hours of testing should be fine for this. </p>

         <br>


         <b> MVF2: Quick Booking : 20 hours </b>

         <ul>
            <li> 4 hours: learning </li>
            <li> 3 hours: research </li>
            <li> 3 hours: design </li>
            <li> 7 hours: coding </li>
            <li> 3 hours: testing </li>
         </ul>

         <p> The quick bookings feature is the main feature of the application, being able to book a parking spot
            through the application with minimal effort. This feature will need extensive communication with servers in
            order to process booking requests and ensure that a booking is valid and available. Browsing through similar
            applications and noting similarities would be a good place to start, and knowledge of reading and writing to
            data storage locations will be required, so the combined 7 hours of learning and research would be
            appropriate for this situation. Once again, the design of this feature's interface would mean the difference
            between a happy user and an unhappy user, meaning the difference between a user who successfully makes a
            booking and one who has no luck at all. 3 hours of design work should be adequate for this feature. 7 hours
            of coding would be the best-case scenario for this feature, assuming there are no issues with connecting
            with the data server to get information about bookings as well as uploading information about the current
            booking being completed. This feature must work perfectly, as if it doesn't, could mean even more issues
            with other aspects of the application. 3 hours of testing should be adequate for this, testing the different
            possible scenarios and ensuring there is extensive error prevention. </p>

         <br>

         <b> MVF3: Live Tracking and Built-in GPS : 15 hours </b>

         <ul>
            <li> 2 hours: learning </li>
            <li> 4 hours: research </li>
            <li> 3 hours: design </li>
            <li> 5 hours: coding </li>
            <li> 1 hours: testing </li>
         </ul>

         <p> The live tracking and GPS feature is one which wouldn't be too difficult to implement. One could utilise
            the built-in map application on the user's device by simply launching, or linking it, from with the Quick
            Park application. 2 hours of learning and 4 hours of research should be allocated to looking into the map
            API, such as Apple Maps and Google Maps, and how these could be integrated within the application. 3 hours
            of design should be allocated to this feature, ensuring that the map and navigation display correctly, and
            would be viewable and varied screen sizes. 1 hour of testing should be suitable for this feature by testing
            several addresses of parking locations and confirming that the directions and the map are displayed
            correctly. </p>


         <br>
         <b> MVF4: Payment: 10 hours </b>

         <ul>
            <li> 2 hours: learning </li>
            <li> 2 hours: research </li>
            <li> 2 hours: design </li>
            <li> 3 hours: coding </li>
            <li> 1 hours: testing </li>
         </ul>

         <p> The payment feature would also not be too difficult to implement into the application. One could utilise in
            built in payment system on the user's device, Apple Pay, etc. 2 hours of learning and 2 hours of research
            should be allocated on looking into how to manage payment information, ensuring high security and privacy,
            and how one could use online payment systems such as PayPal. 2 hours of design would be suitable for
            designing an appealing payment interface so that the user is always exposed to the current status of the
            system. 3 hours of coding would be suitable in ensuring proper error prevention and that all validation has
            been applied to fields. </p>

         <br>
         <b> MVF5: Contact Us and Feedback: 7 hours </b>

         <ul>
            <li> 1 hours: learning </li>
            <li> 1 hours: research </li>
            <li> 2.5 hours: design </li>
            <li> 2 hours: coding </li>
            <li> 0.5 hours: testing </li>
         </ul>

         <p> The contact and feedback page would be the simplest feature to develop, as all that is required are two
            forms, and the ability to send those forms to an email, such as the quick park admin. 2 hours of learning
            and research should be allocated to this task, to browse through possible design ideas of other forms, as
            well as how to submit a form to an email address. 2.5 hours should be suitable for designing all forms and
            making sure they are appealing to the user. 2 hours for coding and ensuring validation has been implemented.
            Half an hour for testing, as all you need to test is that the form has been submitted and received by the
            quick park admin email. </p>

         <br>


         <b> EVF1: Integration for Business: 15 hours </b>

         <ul>

         </ul>

         <p> This extended feature is aimed towards businesses, and providing extra features to suite the needs of the
            business. The registration page will need to adapt to be able to handle business registration. 2 hours of
            learning and 3 hours of research can be assigned to looking into other applications with a separate business
            integration. 3 hours of design should be allocated to the parts of the application that will need
            modification. 5 hours of coding to implement the required changes, and 2 hours to test these changes by
            going through the registration process as a business and ensuring these features work. </p>

         <p> This feature may be a bit challenging to develop, hence being an extended feature. This feature would
            require the cooperation of other companies such as Apple and Google so that Quick Park services can be
            integrated from directly within their maps application, much like how Uber is integrated. 6 hours of
            learning and research will need to be conducted into how this can be achieved. 2 hours of design work of
            linking the interface within the application. 3 hours of coding to account for these changes within our
            features. 1 hour of testing to ensure that our services are visible from within the map applications.</p>

            This will take some time as I do not have extensive knowledge in this area. In addition, it will take some
            time to make sure that the designs are user friendly and user testing will also need to be included to get

         <p> This feature is likely to be one of the most complex parts of the app as it will involve having knowledge
            in several coding languages, mapping services APIs (such as Google Maps), coding validations, integrations
            into existing car complex systems for availability of parking spaces, and real time systems for e-ticket
            countdowns. </p>

         <p> This will require knowledge in the area of APIs and mapping services, will also need knowledge in GPS
            system integrations and real time accuracy (i.e. low latency). Being able to use an existing mapping service
            such as Google Maps will allow the development time to decrease as the major parts of the feature will
            become integration into the app. </p>

         <p> The payment feature of the app will not be complicated, in the sense that it is a simple feature and
            therefore not requires as much time as some other features, but this feature will require the most attention
            in regards to security and privacy. The payment feature will need to be built with the users privacy and
            security in mind. This means that all data being stored and transferred will need to be heavily encrypted
            and code will need to be constantly maintained to ensure that no bugs or security flaws can arise. </p>

         <p> This will be a simple feature which allows customers to either contact Quick Park by email or phone, and in
            addition will allows users to give a review and send feedback to the Quick Park staff. The main parts of
            this feature will be making sure that only valid text is entered and that the user enters the required
            fields. I will need to learn about how to make validations efficient so that minimal code can be used to

         <p> This would require a collaboration between two companies which can become time consuming. Both companies

         <p> This section I believe will require about 25 hours of work from each of us to get going. 10 hours to help code and finalise the applications/service itself, 5 from us each to set up servers and about 5 implement this into the application itself. We may also need 5 hours to research prior information as to how servers are set up and certain coding techniques that may assist in our overall final product and experience. While these times may sound short, if we are all working on it together as a group I believe the time it takes to complete will be much shorter than if only one person was helping set up, as well as less stress inducing. </p>

         </ul>

         <p> The addition of quick bookings should only take about 10 hours from each of us to successfully finish. This is because the main coding of the application is complete and we have some groundwork. This means we can build on top of this and add the correct functions and formulas to the coding to help create the quick booking system rather easily, but still may require some research as to how we can accomplish this. A possible extra 5 hours if we are still not confident in our ability to code these functionalities. </p>

            <li> 2 hours: testing </li>
         </ul>

         <p> This section is likely to be the longest section of the production of the application. None of our team have had experience in using GPS trackers within their coding before, and this could prove to be a challenge. As such, we will need to have 10 hours of research/practice with coding such a feature, and then use 10 hours to code/implement this feature into our application. This could prove to be longer if technical difficulties arise or our knowledge isn't as up to standard as we expected with this feature implementation. </p>

         </ul>

         <p> The payment side of things should take about 15 hours from each of us to complete. This is because we will likely only need 5 hours of research to figure out how payment can be stored and used within a server application, and then 10 hours for us to code this feature into our application. This may take longer if we feel our security measures aren't strong enough with withholding information and payment options, but this likely shouldn't add that much more time on to the creation of this feature within the service. </p>

         <p> This section shouldn't take too long, as it essentially just a place for people to contact us.

         </ul>

         <p> This should take us about 20 hours to complete. This is because it would take a while to set up the application for business purposes, and likely several days. If we work for about 5 hours a day, then this could take about 4 days to complete overall (assuming we are working the whole time). This could potentially take less time, but for now I believe 20 hours of work should be enough to help integrate our application for business. </p>

         </ul>

         <p> I believe this should take us about 10 hours, possibly even just 10. This is because if we have already set up our map, it may be likely that we can adapt service apps into the map itself or potentially add some easier access to the rest of our application rather quickly. Overall, this shouldn't take too long in my opinion, and will help give us more accessibility to our application. </p>

         <p> Price Comparison should likely only take 10 hours maximum. We will need to do research to see how our prices fair with competitors, but this should only take a couple of hours. The main amount of time will be spent on implementing this price into our app, as well as making a final decision on pricing. Overall, this shouldn't take as long as other Extended Viable Features. </p>

         </ul>

         <p> The Registration and Profile Editing section will be the first platform that the user sees when accessing
            the application, therefore learning about the data being collected and how it is stored within the system's
            database should be performed. Research is needed to be done about the other competitor applications;
            understanding the types of data that other companies are collecting from their potential users. Further
            investigation needs to be done on the number of questions to ask the user and the types of questions.
            Whether it be user contact details such as name, address, phone number or payment details, the overall form
            should be easy to follow and not too time-consuming. Considerations need to be made about the language and
            the series of questions being asked. We are also required to explore how we can securely store the data
            provided by the users. Exploring and learning about securely storing the private information and the types
            of data collected would be estimated to take the total time of roughly 5 hours.
            The design is a vital element towards the overall look and feel of the Quick Park application. Without a
            solid design, the users won't be able to navigate easily through the application and might feel a sense of
            frustration trying to use the application. All the important features and user login and profile creation
            should be neatly displayed with minimalistic design and follow a good colour scheme so users can easily find
            what they are looking for without feeling overwhelmed. The positioning of the details words such as "Sign
            In" or "Sign Up" is equally important. The user should be able to quickly identify and use the application
            efficiently. The coding aspect will take the most amount of time (7 hours) since it is the start of the
            application and more time will be devoted in researching and devising algorithm's to be able to prompt the
            user to enter the details and store the information entered by the user into a secured storage platform. The
            base code created for the Registration and Profile creation can then be adapted to the remaining features of
            the application to reduce time and effort. The final aspect is the testing which will indicate how user
            friendly the application is for first time users. As the code is being developed the testing is required to
            take place in multiple stages. A final test is also needed to be done to ensure that the final product is
            simple to interact with and the user gets the most out of using the Quick Park application.

            <li> 2 hours: testing </li>

         </ul>

         <p> To be able to make the application a great success, the user needs to be able to swiftly be able to
            navigate and make car park bookings promptly. Learning about the feature itself and the types of ways it can
            be implemented into the system is vital. This process of learning about the feature and seeing how it can be
            implemented is estimated to take about 2 hours. Research needs to be done about the layout of how the
            bookings should be done, how to collect the location information from the user, the types of questions that
            the user should be prompted to answer (undercover or open car park) so that they are allocated to the most
            appropriate parking slot. Investigating competitor/similar applications and documenting the things that are
            appreciated and things that could be improved would take roughly 3 hours to complete. The design is very
            crucial as it determines whether the user will be likely to revisit the application. The layout of how the
            user can select the date, time, enter a location, see the available parking slots are needed to be planned
            and executed. The user should be guided step by step from entering the location details to selecting the
            paring slot and then booking the selected car park. The details of the car park booked and the timings
            should be made prominent to the user to avoid confusions and mistrust. Designing the step by step approach
            and drawing prototypes and experimenting with the main feature of the application is estimated to take a
            minimum of 5 hours. Given that the coding algorithms have been sorted in the MVF1, this can be further
            adapted to create the interface for the MVF2 therefore, it is estimated that 4 hours of coding time would be
            required to complete that feature. Additionally, the testing to see if all the functions are working well
            would be estimated to take 2 hours.

         </ul>

         <p> To be able to add the live tracking and built-in GPS feature, learning and research need to be conducted on
            the risks and privacy breaches associated with the sharing of location and live tracking. An investigation
            needs to be done on how the user's vehicle location will be tracked. Will there be an additional tool/system
            that will be placed within the car to provide updates of the vehicle location? Learning about the feature
            and then being able to research about the practicalities and risks of implementing this feature, is
            estimated to take a total of 6 hours. A further 6 hours is expected to finalise the design aspect and create
            a uniformed layout that indicates to users about the status and location of their vehicle. The coding
            algorithms will be the most challenging and most time consuming (8 hours), as it needs to incorporate live
            updates and provide accurate locations so the user can locate their vehicle. For assignment purposes and
            given the time constraints of the project, this feature might be excluded from the overall design or perhaps
            be replaced with a prototype version, that is required to be further developed. Finally, the testing would
            be estimated to take around 2 hours to complete, as the accuracy of the locations and live updates will need
            to be checked and assessed. </p>

            <li> 2 hours: testing </li>

         </ul>

         <p> The payment feature is pretty straight forward and is estimated to an hour in terms of learning and
            understanding what is involved. Research is required to understand how to handle payments and the procedures
            of how to collect and store card details from the user so that they are not needing to enter payment details
            continuously. The research aspect is expected to take a total of 2 hours to explore the legal requirements
            associated with payment handling as well as considering the practicality of implementing the feature.
            Designing the payment feature is expected to take 1-2 hours. Considerations of establishing a design that is
            minimalistic and contains the right amount of details on the page is important. Since the design is being
            adopted across the other MVF features for uniformity, less time will be taken for the payment section. The
            user should be able to add the card details and make the booking and payments effortlessly. The coding
            section is expected to take 5 hours to complete as the user will need to enter the details and it needs to
            be stored, verified and then processed. Conclusively, the testing will take 2 hours to ensure that there are
            no glitches or errors in processing the payments.

         </ul>

         <p> The contact us and feedback feature is estimated to take a total of 2 hours collectively for learning and
            research. This feature enables the users to provide feedback or raise any concerns with the service being
            provided. Hence the system is required to provide a text box and form that is allocated to a particular
            email so that any issues or concerns can be addressed promptly. The designing is expected to take 2 hours,
            following the design structure of the previous 4 MVF's the contact us and feedback feature should contain
            relevant information regarding how the user can connect and contact the staff members to address any issues
            or suggestions they may have about the service. The coding would take 4 hours, as the user input needs to be
            stored and addressed to the management team so it can further be investigated. The testing would be expected
            to take 2 hours, therefore any glitches can be fixed.

         </ul>

         <p> In terms of addressing the learning and research aspect, a total of 7 hours is estimated. Research and
            understanding how to change the current registration systems to best cater to businesses needs and general
            public needs will be required to be done. Considerations on how the data is stored will be needed to be
            investigated as the data pool will be increased to capturing data about the business user and other users
            and their usage and payment history. The design will have to be recreated to implement the additional
            elements and ensure the user can distinctive identify the business edition to the normal standard individual
            users edition. The coding is expected to take 8 hours, as the code is required to be remodelled to cater to
            business requirements. Lastly, the testing is estimated to take 3 hours, to verify there are no glitches or
            any issues with the system. </p>

            explore the security and privacy protocols of both Apple and Google services and acquire authorisation to
            implement the feature into Quick Park Application. The design layout can be adapted from MVF3 (Live Tracking
            and Built-In GPS), therefore less time is needed to be dedicated towards the design aspect of this feature.
            The coding and testing are expected to take a total of 12 hours combined. Complex code algorithms are needed
            to be devised to allow the integration of mapping services into the application. Testing is required to be
            conducted to ensure that the feature is running smoothly and there are no glitches present. </p>

         </ul>

         <p> Learning and researching combined is estimated to take around 6 hours to complete. Research about
            competitor applications and their pricing is needed to be investigated thoroughly. The hourly parking rates
            and the additional discounts or seasonal promotions are needed to be explored, to provide Quick Park
            customers with the most competitive price. The design layout will need to be created from scratch, therefore
            6 hours are allocated to plan and develop possible prototypes which can later be implemented. The coding and
            testing are combinedly estimated to take 10 hours. 8 of these hours allocated to coding and being able to
            store and display the current market prices for pre-booked parking's. The testing is needed to be done to
            ensure that the price comparisons are accurate and up-to-date as per the conditions of the organisation.

         </ul>
         <p>This will likely be one of the largest sections of our app as it requires working knowledge of data storage
            so that we can securely store our users private information, as well as devising an interface that is easy
            to interact with. The load can easily be split six ways so that we all do a fair amount of work and still
            hit a fair target for the estimated time.</p>

         <p>Given that MVF1 will give us the basic layout of the app it's a matter of replicating this interface and
            using it to device the quick bookings section. The knowledge of data storage from MVF1 will mean that we
            will already know how to store this booking data so it is accessible later by the user.</p>
