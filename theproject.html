         <p>Finding parking within CBD's in Australia can be challenging, especially during peak hours. The development
            of 'Quick Park' application will assist users to conveniently park their vehicles amidst all the hustle
            bustle within the city. Users are required to install the application, register their vehicle, enter their
            card details, location and get started. </p>
         <p>The app will highlight all the available parking and indicate the distance from the user to the car park.
            Users can check the most convenient parking and can select and book the desired parking lot. Once booked,
            the parking will be reserved for a given duration and the user will have a guaranteed car parking lot
            available for the selected time period. The user will receive turn by turn instruction on how to get to the
            carpark. They are also given the option to pre-book a day ahead meaning that the car parking service is
            allocated for a given time period, but the user must enter and exit the parking lot within strict timings to
            avoid penalties. Using the app, users can utilise cash less payment system and manage parking fees and
            extend/shorten carpark time, thereby only paying for the exact amount of time they used the service. </p>
         <p>Having reserved parking means that you don't have to worry about being late to work or an important occasion
            trying to find parking. Just within a few clicks on your mobile device you can enjoy simple and effortless
            parking options, whilst receiving updates on the vehicle condition and location. The live navigation system
            will ensure that you'll never have to go looking for where you parked your car every again. Quick Park
            application aims to reduce stress for car drivers, finding an affordable and convenient parking within busy
            business districts in Australia.</p>

The diagram depicts the architectural diagram of how users are able to access and operate using the ‘Quick Park’ Application. The web server will contain data regarding the number of hireable carparks, the number of available carparks, the number of booked car parks, costing for car parks, maximum number of hours to hire etc. These data will then made available to the portable devices such as tablets, phones, laptops as well as desktop computers. Therefore when an individual is looking to make a booking, they are able to access it on the device of their choice and be able to secure a parking booking. As the user enters their desired location, the application will use data stored within the cloud and web servers to indicate the available parking lots given that particular day and time and will also list the costing and number of hours available to hire. The user will be given step by step prompts to finalise and confirm the booking before they are able to use the service.
The cloud and the web server will also store information about the clients details upon registration, hiring details and feedback/communications. Therefore the user is able to continue using the application and are not required to enter their details every time they need to use it. The usage history and payment details will be stored within the cloud to allow users to get an understanding of how regularly they utilise the service, and how much they are spending weekly, monthly or even yearly on parking. Storing the payment details will allow for quick access to the service and avoid any issues regarding service delay. From a business stand point the company can use the data to see the popularity of the service and make modifications to better improve the service and increase the clientele.
