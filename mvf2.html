         <h4 id="mvf2LucidTextualInformation">Lucid Textual Explanation</h4>
         <p>
         <ul>
            <li>Upon tapping on 'Book Parking,' the user will be prompted to pick a destination using the map within the
               application to determine where they intend to go. The user will also have a list of frequent locations to
               select from if they have been known to go to certain places regularly. This will be in a small menu below
               the application.</li>
               <br>
            <li>The user will then enter a date and time as to which they'll need the parking space. The user will also
               have to select which vehicle they are using from the list below.</li>
               <br>
            <li>The application will then give a list of the closest free parking spaces based on the location the user
               wishes to go to. This will be a scroll-able menu, with also a choice of payment method needed at the

         <h4 id="mvf2UserStories">User Stories</h4>
         <p style="font-style: italic;">"As a manager, I want to save my time so that I don't arrive late to work"</p>
         <p>The quick booking feature should allow the user to swiftly and effortlessly make bookings within a given
            period. The users should find it convenient to navigate through and also be able to manage their time
            efficiently. The Quick Park application should be able to prompt users to select, confirm and finalise the
            parking lot and have it ready for the user on the day and time that they require. Ultimately, the app will
            help users save time in searching for parking and can help them get to work stress-free and effortlessly.
            Individuals will feel a bit of relief that they have a back-up solution when it comes to parking and will be
            more prepared when it comes to going somewhere.</p>

         <br>

         <p style="font-style: italic;">"As a beginner driver, I want to have a secured route with parking so I can
            avoid getting stressed"</p>
         <p>A new driver will be less assertive in their parking skills and may require either more time to develop
            confidence. The Quick Park will be able to offer quick guidance in registering and be able to allow the user
            to not only find parking conveniently within proximity of their location of choice and secure it for the
            user. This will able to help the novice drivers to build confidence as they have parking secured in a
            location that they are comfortable and are not required to worry about parking, especially in busy
            locations. Having the application handy, will allow them to reduce stress and continue to build their
            confidence in both driving and parking in new unfamiliar locations.</p>

         <br>

         <p style="font-style: italic;">"As a mum of three, I want to find a convenient parking location, so I can drop
            my children off to kindergarten safely and effortlessly"</p>
         <p>For individuals who have children or undertake a lot of responsibility, the Quick Park application can offer
            the guidance for them to find parking and be able to carry out their daily tasks safely and smoothly without
            any additional tension. The app will allow the user to browse through and select the nearest convenient
            available parking lot which then can be booked and secured. This way the user can carry out through their

         <h4 id="mvf2ValidationCriteria">Validation Criteria</h4>
         <p>There are several validation types that can be used to check data and information that is being entered by a
            user.</p>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Format check: </b>this is used to check if data is in the correct format. In relation to the quick
               bookings page, this can be used when the user enters a date and time for their parking reservation, as
               these are examples of data fields that need to be entered in a specific format. The date and time could
               also be validated by utilising a date / time picker on the device.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Existence check: </b>this is used to check if data has been entered at all. In relation to the quick
               bookings page, all fields such as location, date, time, vehicle, parking space and payment method will
               need to be validated as having something entered in the field.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Lookup table: </b>this is used to check for acceptable values in a table. In relation to the quick
               bookings page, when the user specifies the parking address, it needs to be cross checked using an
               external database such as google maps, in order to confirm that the address exists.</li>
            <br>
         </ul>
         <p>We also need to determine a list of acceptance criteria to help us set a user's expectation for our
            application. This can be done by generating possible scenarios that a user may experience and outline the
            expectations of that scenario. We can generate this using the Given/When/Then template.</p>
            <ul>
               <p><b>Scenario: </b>User makes a booking</p>
               <p>"Given I'm in a role of a registered user</p>
               <p>When I open the bookings page</p>
               <br>
               <p>Then the system shows me location form containing "Location of Choice" and "Frequent Locations" of which only one of these is required</p>
               <p>When I fill in "Location of Choice" with a valid location</p>
               <p>Or When I select a "Frequent Location" from the provided list</p>
               <p>And I click the "Continue" button</p>
               <br>
               <p>Then the system shows me the booking form containing "Date", "Time" and "Choose a Vehicle" which are required fields </p>
               <p>When I fill in the "Date" with a valid date</p>
               <p>And I fill in the "Time" with a valid time </p>
               <p>And I "Choose a Vehicle" by using the checkboxes </p>
               <p>And I click the "Next" button </p>
               <br>
               <p>Then the system shows me the booking form containing "Select Available Parking Space" and "Payment" which are required fields </p>
               <p>And I "Select Available Parking Space" by using the checkboxes </p>
               <p>And I select a "Payment Method" by using the checkboxes </p>
               <p>And I click the "Next" button </p>
               <br>
               <p>Then the system shows me the booking summary screen </p>
               <p>And I click the "Confirm Booking" button </p>
               <br>
               <p>Then the system shows me the booking confirmed screen"</p>
